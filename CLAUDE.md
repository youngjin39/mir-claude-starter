## Workflow Pipeline

### Ambiguous Request Gate
If a request contains zero specificity signals (file path, function name, numbered step, error message) → deep-interview.
Can be bypassed with the `force:` prefix.

### Task Flow
```
Request → specificity signals? → none → deep-interview → classify
  ├─ simple (1~2 steps) → orchestrator executes directly → self-check → done
  └─ complex (3+ steps) → plan mode
       brainstorming → writing-plans → execution → verification → done
```

### Orchestration Presets
| Preset | Pipeline |
|---|---|
| feature | brainstorming → writing-plans → executor → testing → code-review → verification |
| bugfix | deep-interview(lite) → executor → testing → verification |
| refactor | brainstorming → writing-plans → executor → code-review → verification |
| security | code-review(security) → executor → verification |

### Agent Role Separation
| Agent | Model | Role | Writes Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| main-orchestrator | opus | conversation, judgment, classification, simple task execution | Yes (simple) |
| executor-agent | sonnet | dedicated sub-agent for complex task code writing | Yes (complex) |
| quality-agent | sonnet | read-only review. Write/Edit forbidden. | No |

### Branching Criteria
- **Simple (1~2 steps)**: orchestrator executes directly. When executor call overhead exceeds the work involved.
- **Complex (3+ steps)**: brainstorming → writing-plans → executor → verification pipeline.
- When criteria are ambiguous, classify as complex (overestimating is safer than underestimating).

### Gate Conditions
| Phase | Entry | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| brainstorming | complex classification | user design approval |
| writing-plans | brainstorming exit | includes concrete code + commands + expected output |
| execution | writing-plans exit | all steps complete or 3 failures → STOP |
| verification | execution exit | verification passed based on execution evidence |

### Built-in Rules
- brainstorming: must compare 2~3 alternatives with different lenses. Counter-narrative mandatory.
- writing-plans: no abstract expressions. Include actual code. Banned: "add tests", "refactor as needed".
- execution: 3-failure circuit breaker → revisit architecture. Use git worktree for risky changes.
- verification: "should work", "probably fine" forbidden. Evidence only. Red Team 5Q after gate pass.

## Skill Trigger System (body loaded via Read when triggered)

### Trigger Types
| Type | How it fires | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Keyword | Request contains listed keywords | "test", "review", "commit" |
| Intent | Inferred user goal | "add feature" → brainstorming, "fix bug" → deep-interview(lite) |
| File path | Changed/mentioned file matches pattern | `*.test.*` → testing, `*.md` → skip lint |
| Code pattern | Code contains risky patterns | external input handling → security review |

When triggered: report trigger reason + loaded skill(s) (max 3) in one line.

### Skill Keyword Table

| Keyword | Skill | Path |
|---|---|---|
| review, PR, quality, merge check, post-completion | code-review | .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md |
| test, TDD, unit test, integration test | testing | .claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md |
| commit, git, save changes | git-commit | .claude/skills/git-commit/SKILL.md |
| diagnose, doctor, health check, status | project-doctor | .claude/skills/project-doctor/SKILL.md |
| design, brainstorming, architecture, new feature | brainstorming | .claude/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md |
| plan, implementation plan, step design | writing-plans | .claude/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md |
| verify, done check, proof, self-check | verification | .claude/skills/verification/SKILL.md |
| interview, requirements, clarify, ambiguous | deep-interview | .claude/skills/deep-interview/SKILL.md |

> On skill trigger: update `last_used` + `count` in docs/memory-map.md Skill Usage table.

## Model Routing
| Task Type | Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| file search, keyword lookup, simple transformation | haiku | mechanical, no judgment needed |
| code writing, bug fixing, testing | sonnet | implementation capability required |
| architecture design, planning, review synthesis | opus | complex judgment + context understanding |

## Memory System (3 layers)

### Layer 1: Project Knowledge (docs/) — what we know
- Long-term memory. No decay. Permanently preserved.
- Keyword index (memory-map.md) → category → file. Load only what is needed.
- Max 50 lines per file (exception: `type: archive` files). Frontmatter: title, keywords, created, last_used.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Rules (tasks/lessons.md) — what to do / not do
- Failure/success table → promoted to rule after 2 repetitions.
- Must be read at session start.

### Layer 3: Session Restore (tasks/sessions/) — ephemeral snapshots
- What Worked / What Did NOT Work / Decisions / Next Step.
- Only the most recent snapshot is valid. Older ones are promoted to docs/ or deleted.

### Memory Usage Protocol
1. Task start: scan memory-map.md keyword table.
2. If a relevant keyword exists, Read only that file.
3. If none, skip (token savings).
4. Task complete: new learnings → save to docs/{category}/ + update index.

## Autonomous Bug Fix
- Bug report received → investigate and fix without waiting for instructions.
- Still follows the pipeline: classify → execute → verify. Autonomy applies to initiation, not to skipping gates.

## Context Management
- Consider /compact at logical transition points: research → planning, debug → feature.
- Write a handoff to tasks/handoffs/ before compacting.
- Do not start complex tasks in the last 20% of the context window.
- **Context recovery**: on session break or compact, re-read plan.md + lessons.md + latest session snapshot → produce 3-line summary → resume from there.

### Sub-agent Isolation
- NEVER pass session history to sub-agents.
- Extract only the necessary context from the handoff document and pass that.
- 1 sub-agent = 1 task = minimum context.
- After sub-agent completes: receive results only. Discard internal process.

## Automation Hooks (.claude/hooks/)
- **SessionStart**: auto-load plan.md + lessons.md + most recent session.
- **PreCompact**: auto-generate handoff skeleton + reminder.
- **PostToolUse(Edit|Write)**: debug statement + credential leak detection.

## Automatic Memory Harvesting
- On task completion, assess: "Was anything new learned?"
- If yes → save to docs/{category}/ + update memory-map.md.
- If no → skip (prevent unnecessary memory bloat).

## Quality Checks
- Record every change in change_log.md.
- After completion, run lint/static analysis. Fix 0~3 errors immediately; 4+ errors → quality-agent.
- Self-check: error handling + security on the 2 most recently modified files.

## Project Management
- At start, read plan + lessons (SessionStart hook injects automatically). Checklist via manual Read.
- Before proceeding with changes, update plan and checklist.
- On feature completion, archive to tasks/log/.

## Language Protocol
- User-facing output (reports, task logs) → Korean.
- Internal (agent comms, handoffs, docs/, skills, code, commits) → English.
- English is ~2-3x more token-efficient for same information.

## Principles
- **Default is no-action.** Do not act without evidence. Unverified conclusions are void.
- Simplicity first. Minimum impact.
- Solve root causes. No workarounds.
- **Prohibition > instruction.** Explicit bans are stronger than vague guidance. When defining behavior, state what is forbidden before what is desired.
- **No filler.** Ban: repetition, padding adjectives, hedging phrases ("전반적으로", "다만", "arguably"). Every sentence must carry information.
