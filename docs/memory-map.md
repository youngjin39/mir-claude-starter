## Protocols
- **Search**: Scan keyword table → Read matched file only → If file has `related` field, consider loading related files too → Skip if no match.
- **Store**: Create `docs/{category}/{topic}.md` with frontmatter (title, keywords, related, created, last_used) → Add keyword row here.
- **Cascade**: On store, check keyword table for existing files sharing keywords. Review for contradiction/overlap → update affected files + their `last_used`. A single insight may touch multiple files.
- **Promote**: 2+ repetitions → lessons.md rule. Cross-project → ~/.claude/global-memory/.
