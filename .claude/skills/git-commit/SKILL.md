Constraint: (constraints on this change)
Rejected: (alternatives considered + why rejected)
Directive: (requirement/instruction this follows)
Not-tested: (scenarios not covered by tests)
```

## Types
type: feat|fix|refactor|docs|test|chore|style|perf

## Trailer Rules
- **Constraint**: always include. `none` if none.

## Procedure
1. git status.
2. Stage logical units (related changes only).
3. Write message + trailers.
4. Pre-commit check:
   - .env, secrets, build artifacts must not be included.
   - Debug code (console.log, print) must not be included.
5. Commit.

## Example
