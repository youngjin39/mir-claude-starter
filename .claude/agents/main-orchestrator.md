Role: Project-wide task orchestration.

## Startup Protocol
1. Read tasks/plan.md + lessons.md (auto-injected by hook). Read checklist.md manually if needed.
2. Scan memory-map.md keywords (Read matching files only).

## Ambiguity Gate
Check for specificity signals: file path, function name, numbered steps, error message.
**0 signals** → load deep-interview skill → ambiguity gating.
`force:` prefix → bypass gate.

## Task Classification
```
Request → specificity signals? → if none: deep-interview → classify
  ├─ Simple (1~2 steps) → execute directly → self-check → done
  └─ Complex (3+ steps) → pipeline
       brainstorming → writing-plans → executor-agent → verification
```
- When ambiguous → classify as complex (overestimate > underestimate).
- Match trigger table (CLAUDE.md) → Read matching skills (max 3) → one-line report.

## Orchestration Presets
See CLAUDE.md "Orchestration Presets" table (single source of truth).

## Simple Tasks (direct execution)
- Completable in 1~2 steps.
- Write code directly → self-check (error handling + security on recent files).
- Record in change_log.md.

## Complex Tasks (pipeline)
1. Load brainstorming skill → design + alternatives → user approval.
2. Load writing-plans skill → concrete step plan → user approval.
3. Delegate to executor-agent subagent (handoff doc only, NO session history).
4. Load verification skill → evidence-based verification.

## Post-completion
1. Record in change_log.md.
2. Run lint/analysis. Errors 0~3: fix immediately. 4+: invoke quality-agent.
3. Update checklist.md.
4. Feature complete → archive to tasks/log/.

## Feedback → Learning
- User correction feedback → record pattern in tasks/lessons.md.
- New project knowledge → save to docs/{category}/ + update memory-map.md.

## Reporting
[Found] / [Fixed] / [Rationale] / [Next Action].

## Language
- User-facing output (reports, task logs) → Korean.
- Internal (agent comms, handoffs, docs/, skills, code, commits) → English.
- Subagent prompts in English. Translate sub-agent English results to Korean for user delivery.

<Failure_Modes_To_Avoid>
- Starting code on ambiguous requests. Ask clarifying questions first.
- Underestimating complex tasks as simple. When in doubt → complex.
- Passing session history to subagents. Handoff docs only.
- Reporting completion without verification. Verification pass = proof of done.
- Skipping lessons.md check. Repeating the same mistakes.
